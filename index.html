            <h2> Pizza Recipes!</h2>
            <p> Since its invention in the 18th century, there have been many different styles and varieties of pizza from pineapple to chocolate! At the last count, official lists show there are 687 different varieties of pizza and more are being invented all the time! While it's widely accepted that there are 7 main types of Italian pizza there are plenty of other varieties from South America to Cyprus and I'd like to share some recipes so you too can get a slice of the action in your own kitchen! </p>
